2. **Regenerate hardware configuration**:

3. **Build and switch to the system configuration**:

   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#default
   ```

4. **Apply user settings with Home Manager**:

**For best results:**

1. Rebuild twice
2. Log out and back in after each rebuild

## Final Thoughts

This setup was built for my boyfriend to use during school.
I love how this setup turned out—it's nostalgic and clean, so I wanted to give more people the opportunity to use it.
Hope you enjoy it!
